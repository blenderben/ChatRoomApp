ChatRoomApp
===========

A simple Android mobile application that uses XMPP and connects to an eJabberd server.

New to Android and mobile app development, I created this during a summer internship in Taipei.  For obvious reasons, I have omitted the server address and replaced it with a more generic one.

  If you wish to test this app for yourself, please make sure you provide the app a properly configured ejabberd server with the chatroom module installed/enabled.  Change any instance of "ejabberd.server.com" to your proper one and login with proper credentials and it should work.
